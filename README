This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game for android. Rock, Paper, Scissors is very popular in Japan where it is used for making all kinds of important decisions (like who has to go get the ball back from the neigbours after breaking their window). 

Not only is this an homage to this ancient and revered game but it is also a project for me to learn Android. I'm happy to hear any feedback (particularly advice on best practises).
